This project involved creating a visualization for United States Geological Surevey (USGS) Earthquake data. The data covers all earthquakes from the past week. 

## Tools Used
The project consisted of leveraging the following tools:
- HTML and CSS
- JavaScript

## Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization
To create the earthquake map, the following steps were executed.

1. Identify which dataset to use and gather the earthquake data from the USGS website. 
2. Import the data by making a connection to the URL endpoint
3. Plot all the earthquakes based on their latitude and longitude. 
4. Change the size of the markers to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake. 
5. Change the colors of the magnitude to reflect the depth of the earthquake, and add a legend for the depth color meanings on the map. 
6. Include popups for each marker to include information about its magnitude, location, and depth.
